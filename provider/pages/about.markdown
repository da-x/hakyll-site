Hello. I am Dan Aloni. Born in 1982, fantasized about programming a computer some time around 1988, finally got around to it circa 1992, and had not stopped since.

I tend to spread on the full programming spectrum, from low-level Linux kernel hacking and machine code (authored [coLinux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Linux), contributed various patches and fixes, contributed the first [e1000 chipset emulation in QEMU](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2007-09/msg00010.html)) to compilers, Haskell programming, software packaging and build automation.

Other interests are playing and studying music, languages, and knowledge in various fields of science. Academically, I am focused on Computer Science.

Without starting any flame-wars, my editor of choice is [Emacs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) and my desktop OS is [Fedora Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_%28operating_system%29).
